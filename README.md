# Maps to Downsize Poverty

This was my senior project for the completion of my undergraduate studies at the University of La Verne, where I majored in Information Technology as part of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I was tasked with implementing an individual project that included skills from a course I took as part of my major's curriculum and some skill I learned for this project. When determining what focus I wanted my project to have I was motivated to find how I could include my passiono for public policy along with my programming abilities. 

I took inspiration from a non-profit organization I interned with prior to my senior year: The Borgen Project, an organization focused on advocating for federal policy that helps reduce global poverty. Taking the skills I learned in my Intro to GIS and Management Information Systems courses along with Python that I began to learn on my own I created multiple map visualizations that provide a narrative on teffect of global poverty and the importance of policy efforts. My visualizations are publihed as a ArcGIS StoryMap.
